# Bad Repository

This is an example of a bad GitHub repository.


## Overview
This repository was created with the aim of showcasing an example of a bad repository to my trainees during one of my career coaching sessions on a topic titled: Documenting Data Science Projects in GitHub. This example illustrates several common issues found in poorly maintained repositories. It also highlights the reasons why it is considered a poor GitHub repository.


## Installation

Use `pip` to install the requirements.


# Issues in the Repository
1. **Poor Documentation:** The README.md file provides minimal information and lacks details on the purpose of the repository, how to contribute, and detailed usage instructions.
2. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** The naming conventions used in the repository are inconsistent (e.g., main.py and utils.py).
3. **Lack of Testing:** The test directory contains a test file with no tests implemented.
4. **Unorganized Code:** The code in main.py and utils.py is not well-organized or modular.
5. **Missing Dependencies:** The requirements.txt file is empty, not specifying any dependencies that the project might have.
6. **Hardcoded File Paths:** The file path "data.txt" is hardcoded in the main.py script, which is not a good practice for flexibility and scalability.
